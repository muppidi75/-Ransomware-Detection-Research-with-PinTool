I worked on a research project that used PinTool, a dynamic instrumentation tool for analyzing function calls and real-time threat identification, to detect ransomware. The project entailed using fundamental cybersecurity principles to monitor function calls and analyze system behavior in order to identify ransomware activity. This strategy sought to strengthen security measures and advance techniques for identifying malicious activity.

I carried out extensive research during the project to improve threat detection methods, utilizing a variety of tools and approaches to keep ahead of changing cyberthreats. In order to guarantee greater accuracy and efficiency, I also worked with peers to validate detection techniques and improve the analysis procedure. Furthermore, the study helped create proactive plans to reduce possible security threats. This encounter improved my abilities.
